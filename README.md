# Myze

## What is Myze?
Myze is simply describe as a self-directed financial tracker. Every piece of data is at the discretion of the user as it does not connect to your banking information for security reasons. 

## What can Myze do?
Myze allows users to do the basics like creating accounts and transactions. Myze also allows you to track your recurring transactions which in turn can provide insights into upcoming transaction and future account balances. 

## What is expected of Myze in the future?
There are a lot of implementations lined up for Myze, but the timeline for these is uncertain, and may not even make the cut. Some of the implementations include but are not limited to:
- Improved Analytics (Filter by Category, Vendor, Date Range, etc)
- Email/SMS alerts of upcoming recurring transactions. (Ability to set different intervals ex. 1 week before, 1 day before)
- SMS bot to quickly check balances and add transactions
- Notification of missing transactions to be entered from recurring transactions
- Joint account access across users
  - Create permissions for account users
  
  
 ## How is Myze built?
 Myze has gone through different iterations even on repositories before this one. It's safe to say that Myze is using a Vue.js and TailwindCSS on the front-end side and using Supabase for a serverless database. Serverless functions are likely to be required in the future, but no decision has been made yet.
